As part of a guest lecture for DevOps course at UL FRI, we'll hear from Teodor Podobnik, Cloud Operations Lead at Prewave, and a recognized advocate in the eBPF community (https://ebpf.io). As an inaugural eBPF Fellowship recipient and eBPF Summit Hackathon Judge, he specializes in applying kernel-level insights and performance optimizations to cloud infrastructure. Teodor shares his expertise through active open-source contributions and as the creator of eBPFChirp, a leading newsletter and podcast dedicated to the eBPF ecosystem. 

He will lead you through: 
- A short introduction on why eBPF (https://ebpf.io) is widely used today and how to "catch the wave", where it fits, what problems it solves, and why now is the right time to learn it.
- A hands-on workshop, where you'll learn the fundamentals of eBPF through a guided coding lab, running entirely in the browser, no local setup required. 
- Open, free-form discussions, including real-world stories, practical advice, and lessons learned from applying eBPF in production environments. 

 Whether you're new to eBPF or already familiar with a bit of Linux internals, this session is designed to be practical, accessible, and immediately useful. 

Bring your laptop!

Who should attend? Anyone working with or interested in cloud-native technologies: developers, architects, students, or anyone eager to dive deeper into kernel engineering. The session will be held either in Slovene or in English, depending on the audience.
