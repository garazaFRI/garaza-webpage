**Yes, this is possible!** FRI Garage has available funds (thanks to sponsors!), which are designed for you and your project.

But this financing has one "restriction":
- after finishing the project, this equipment remains in the FRI Garage and can be used by other teams

This does not apply in cast that your project the prototype device, in this case, of course, we can agree otherwise.
