Our faculty cooperates with different companies and work with them to prepare
our students a number of different challenges. All students, who participate in one of the challenges
can for the duration of the challenge use the premises of Garage for work.

In the Garage, we will also carry out several technical [workshops](/programs/workshops/), led by experts from industry that have launched challenges.
They are intended to both those who participate in the challenges as well as others who are only interested in the topic.

Programming challenges are published on [a separate page](http://www.fri.uni-lj.si/si/raziskave/studentski_izzivi/),
where you can get more information about the challenge. Most of the programming challenges also have published all materials in [Faculty classroom](https://ucilnica.fri.uni-lj.si/course/index.php?categoryid=24).
