Brainstorming and BoF sessions are networking events with the aim to identify
ideas that are then used in th Garage or in a group to learn any new technology.

[BoF sessions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_a_feather_\(computing\))
and brainstorming are in comparison with the workshops ["*Under the hood*"](/programs/workshops/)
more informal, non-structured activites and without pre-prepared detailed agenda.

Good ideas and interesting problems that are still looking for a team that would have "adopted"
them and park in the *Park of ideas*.
