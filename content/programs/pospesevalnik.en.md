The most important Garage activity. Selected student teams build their ideas in the accelerator programs.

Do you have a great idea for a project? In the Garage, we will help you make it come true!

We offer:

- workspace
- mentoring for project (mentors from faculty or industry)
- infrastructure
- [microgrants](/faq/accelerator/microgrants) (read: funds for the purchase of necessary equipment / services / software that you need for the project) 

How do you apply project for Garage:
- send the idea together with description, timeframes and team members to [our email](mailto:garaza@fri.uni-lj.si) or our personal emails in the Garage or on faculty
- if you are accepted in Garage, we specify the details together (finding a mentor, set the timing, resources, milestones of the project)

What we expect:
- regularly working on the project (your team should meet and work at least once a week)
- visible progress of the project (for example: repository on Github)
- **do not neglect your study commitments** while working on your project

Milestones will therefore be set to adapt the expected study obligations (eg. in a weeks, where there are many exams, you plan less activity on the project).
